# SplashScreenApiDemo
Android 12 comes up with new behavior changes that may effect your app. Splash screen is one of them.Â  Android 12 introduces splash screens for all apps. Apps can customize the splash screen in a number of ways to meet their unique branding needs.

Starting in Android 12, the system will always apply new default splash screen on cold and warm starts for all apps which will use your app's launcher icon and the windowBackground of your theme (if it's a single color).
If you are using a custom splash screen in Android 11 or lower, you'll need to migrate your app to the new splash screen.
